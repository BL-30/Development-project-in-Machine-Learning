## :dart: About
I Present the project, the data, the methods you used, the main
development steps.
II Show and comment your results
III Include one part describing what you think are good
programming practices
IV In appendix, provide the logs of your git repository and your
code.

In this project we aim to collaboratively implement this workflow and apply it to different ML problems/datasets

Firstly, we import the dataset
2. Clean the data, perform pre-processing
Replace missing values by average or median values
Center and normalize the data
3. Split the dataset
Split between training set and test set
Split the training set for cross-validation
4. Train the model (including feature selection)
5. Validate the model

You should first clean the dataset (handle missing values and
categorical values)
You may implement feature selection: bruteforce, by looking
at correlations, from an ACP (for classification), by using
Ridge regression (for linear regression), etc.
Do not forget to save a part of your dataset as your test set.
It will not be used for training, but only to assess the quality
of your method.
You may also use cross-validation to adjust the method
(choice of the kernel, feature selection, etc.)
You should automate your process as much as possible

Create a git repository for your group: https://redmine-df.telecom-bretagne.eu/
- Write the Python functions implementing the workflow in one
single .py file.
- Apply the workflow onto the two datasets, using either a Python script or a notebook.
- Important: Your .py file containing the functions must be the same when applied to one or the other dataset
- Each student of the group should write at least one function.
Indicate the writer of each function in comment

## :rocket: Objectives

The following skills/tasks were aimed by this project:

-  Develop good programming practices
-  Use standard development tools
-  Get used to collaborative work
-  Work on Machine-Leaning datasets

- Write the Python functions implementing the workflow in one single .py file.
- Apply the workflow onto the two datasets, using either a Python script or a notebook.
- Important: Your .py file containing the functions must be the same when applied to one or the other dataset
